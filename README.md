## Project overview
This program is used to generate a Bayesian network representing event sequences of the accidents correspoding to **FAR_PART 121** that happened from 1982 to 2006 as reported in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The SQL query used to pull the accident data is saved in the **SQL_query.txt**.
